# PayPal Help Center

This is a responsive web page inspired by the PayPal Help Center, built using React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, and hosted on Netlify. The project showcases the usage of modern web development technologies and follows best practices for creating a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The web page is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the components, ensuring a consistent and modular approach to CSS management.
- **React (Vite) Setup**: The project is set up using Vite, a fast and modern build tool for React applications, providing a smooth development experience.
- **Mobile Menu**: On smaller screens, a hamburger menu is displayed, allowing users to access the navigation links and other features in a compact and user-friendly manner.
- **Dynamic Navigation Links**: The navigation links are generated dynamically using the `map` function, following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle for better code maintainability.
- **Netlify Hosting**: The web page is hosted on Netlify, a popular hosting platform for static websites and single-page applications.
